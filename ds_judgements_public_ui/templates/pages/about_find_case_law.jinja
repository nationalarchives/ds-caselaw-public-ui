    What Find Case Law provides
  {% endcall %}
  {% call heading(tag="h3") %}
    Court and tribunal judgments
  {% endcall %}
  <p>We publish judgments from:</p>
  {% call list(variant="bullets") %}
    {% call list_item() %}
      Appellate courts – Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, High Court
    {% endcall %}
    {% call list_item() %}
      First instance courts – Crown Court, County Court (selected cases)
    {% endcall %}
    {% call list_item() %}
      Tribunals – Employment, Immigration, Tax, and other specialist tribunals
    {% endcall %}
  {% endcall %}
  <p>
    Coverage varies by court and tribunal. Some have comprehensive recent records, while others include selected cases of legal significance.
  </p>
  {% call heading(tag="h3") %}
    Official and authoritative
  {% endcall %}
  <p>
    Find Case Law works directly with the judiciary of England and Wales. Judgments are provided by courts and tribunals themselves, making this the official source for:
  </p>
  {% call list(variant="bullets") %}
    {% call list_item() %}
      accurate judgment text as approved by judges
    {% endcall %}
    {% call list_item() %}
      authoritative citations and case details
    {% endcall %}
    {% call list_item() %}
      timely publication of new decisions
    {% endcall %}
    {% call list_item() %}
      reliable long–term access through The National Archives

    What we include – and what we don't
  {% endcall %}
  {% call heading(tag="h3") %}
    What's in Find Case Law
  {% endcall %}
  <p>We include judgments that serve the public interest and support open justice:</p>
  {% call list(variant="bullets") %}
    {% call list_item() %}
      substantive decisions like full judgments explaining legal reasoning and outcomes
    {% endcall %}
    {% call list_item() %}
      important procedural decisions like significant rulings on practice and procedure
    {% endcall %}
    {% call list_item() %}
      appellate and first instance like decisions from all levels where publicly available
    {% endcall %}
  {% endcall %}
  {% call heading(tag="h3") %}
    What's not included
  {% endcall %}
  <p>Find Case Law is not a comprehensive record of every court case in England and Wales. We don't include:</p>
  {% call list(variant="bullets") %}
    {% call list_item() %}
      most magistrates' court decisions as they handle thousands of cases daily and most are not published
    {% endcall %}
    {% call list_item() %}
      cases subject to restrictions such as judgments that cannot be published due to reporting restrictions, anonymisation requirements, or other legal constraints
    {% endcall %}
    {% call list_item() %}
      cases not in the public interest including some cases that don't contribute to public understanding or legal development
    {% endcall %}
  {% endcall %}
  <p>
    The scope is determined by publication policies of individual courts and tribunals, balanced with considerations of public interest, judicial resources, and privacy.
  </p>
  {% call heading(tag="h2") %}
    Why these limitations exist
  {% endcall %}
  <p>Courts and tribunals produce far more documents than could meaningfully be published:</p>
  <p>
    Volume – Magistrates' courts alone handle over 1.5 million cases annually. Publishing all decisions would be impractical and would not serve users who need to find relevant precedent.
  </p>
  <p>
    Privacy and protection – Some cases involve sensitive personal information, children, or national security matters that require protection even when a judgment is needed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Public interest – Publishing focuses on cases that help people understand the law, set precedent, or involve matters of public importance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Judicial resources – Preparing judgments for publication requires judicial time. Courts prioritise cases where publication serves the public interest.
  </p>
  {% call heading(tag="h2") %}
    How we're expanding
  {% endcall %}
  <p>Find Case Law is continually growing:</p>
  {% call list(variant="bullets") %}
    {% call list_item() %}
      we're working to include judgments from additional courts and tribunals
    {% endcall %}
    {% call list_item() %}
      adding older judgments to provide deeper coverage
    {% endcall %}
    {% call list_item() %}
      adding features that help users find and understand judgments
    {% endcall %}
    {% call list_item() %}
      making judgments easier to access for all users
    {% endcall %}
  {% endcall %}
  <p>The service launched publicly in 2022 and we’re constantly adding new features and expanding what’s available.</p>

  <p>The absence of a case from Find Case Law might mean it:</p>

    {% call list_item() %}
