    <p>This accessibility statement applies to the Case Law service provided by The National Archives.</p>
    <p>
      Accessibility and inclusion are important to everyone at The National Archives and we want as many people
      as possible to be able to use the Case Law service. The text should be
      clear and easy to understand. You should be able to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Change colours, contrast levels and fonts.</li>
      <li>Zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen.</li>
      <li>Navigate most of the website using just a keyboard.</li>
      <li>Navigate most of the website using speech recognition software.</li>
      <li>
        Listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS,
        NVDA and VoiceOver).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>

      testing is conducted in-house using automated tools and the best professional judgment of our digital
      teams. We acknowledge that this approach is not perfect and recognise that we may get some things wrong,
