    <p>This accessibility statement applies to the <a href="{% url 'home' %}">Find Case Law</a> service provided by The National Archives.</p>
    <p>
      Accessibility and inclusion are important to everyone at The National Archives and we want as many people as possible to be able to use the Case Law service. The text should be clear and easy to understand. You should be able to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
      <li>Zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
      <li>Navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
      <li>Navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
      <li>Listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/">AbilityNet</a> has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.</p>
    <p>
      We are continually working to improve the accessibility of our digital services, and to develop our skills in relevant standards and techniques.
      <a href="https://nationalarchives.github.io/engineering-handbook/technology/standards/accessibility/">See our current development standards</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As well as working with third-party accessibility specialists, most of our accessibility testing is conducted in-house using automated tools and the best professional judgment of our digital teams. We acknowledge that this approach is not perfect and recognise that we may get some things wrong.

    <h2 id="section-enforcement">Enforcement procedure</h2>
    <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the 'accessibility regulations'). </p>
    <p>
      If you are not happy with how we respond to your complaint,
      <a href="https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/" target="_blank">contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="section-technical-information">Technical information about this website's accessibility</h2>
    <p>
      The National Archives is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
    </p>
    <h2 id="section-compliance">Compliance status</h2>
    <p>
      The website has been tested against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA standard.</p>
    <p>
      This website is partially compliant with the
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/" target="_blank">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2</a>
      AA standard, due to the non-compliances and exemptions listed below:
    </p>
    <h3>Non-accessible content</h3>
    <p>
      Based on sample testing of pages selected by our user experience and metrics teams, we know that the content listed below is non-compliant with the accessibility regulations for the following reasons:
    </p>
    <p>Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Images within judgment text do not have a text alternative, which means some content is not available when using text-to-speech software (Success Criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content)</li>
      <li>
        Some HTML heading markup has been used in a way that does not accurately represent relationships in the content, which makes the content difficult to understand and navigate for screenreader users (Success Criterion 1.3.1 Info and Relationships).
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="section-burden">Disproportionate burden</h2>
    <p>Not applicable.</p>
    <h2 id="section-scope">Content that's not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Judgment documents, such as PDFs and Word files, are published in the same format and condition in which they were originally submitted to us. This means we do not make changes to improve accessibility, and as a result, some documents may not meet current accessibility standards.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      While reproductions of items in heritage collections are
      <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/4/made" target="_blank">exempt from meeting the accessibility regulations</a>,
      we are investigating ways to use emerging technology to improve the data
      and accessibility of our heritage collections.
    </p>
    <h2 id="section-improve">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>
    <p>The service manual helps our teams build products and services to meet the same accessibility standards.
      Creating an accessible service is a team effort. We want our team to make this service accessible by:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>considering accessibility at the start of their project, and throughout</li>
      <li>making accessibility the whole team's responsibility</li>
      <li>provide accessibility training for our staff</li>
      <li>include individuals with disabilities in our design personas</li>
      <li>researching with users having access needs including some using assistive technologies</li>
      <li>using a library of accessible components and design patterns</li>
      <li>carrying out regular internal and external accessibility audits and testing</li>
      <li>designing and building to level AA of WCAG 2.2</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The accessibility issues highlighted in our latest accessibility test report (include link) have been reviewed, prioritised and fixed.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Screenreader users are informed of their current page in the navigation.</li>
      <li>Graphics used to present the purpose of a link are provided with a descriptive text alternative to inform users of their functionality and purpose.</li>
      <li>Colour contrast issues have been resolved</li>
      <li>Button elements are descriptive of their purpose and function on the page</li>
      <li>Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality,</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="section-preparation">Preparation of this accessibility statement</h2>
