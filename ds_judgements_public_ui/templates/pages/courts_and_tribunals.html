    <p>Courts and tribunals in England and Wales handle different types of legal cases. There are the civil courts, which deal with disputes between individuals or organisations, and the criminal courts, which deal with criminal offences defined by law.</p>

    <p>Decisions made by a court or tribunal may be appealed. The Court of Appeal and the UK Supreme Court are the most senior courts for appeals.</p>

    <p>
