    <h2 id="section-what">What judgments and decisions are</h2>
    <p>A judgment is the decision a court has made after hearing a case. Written judgments are also known as handed down judgments. They can be very long.</p>
    <p>Find Case Law does not provide summaries, interpretation or advice on any judgments or decisions.</p>
    <p>
      Every judgment or decision will start with a 'header' or title page which contains the important information about the judgment or decision, such as:
      <ul>
        <li>Neutral citation</li>
        <li>Case number</li>
        <li>Court or chamber</li>
        <li>Judge name(s)</li>
        <li>Party names</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The way the text of each judgment or decision is written is up to the judge. Typically, judgments will summarise 'the facts' of the case,
      the law that applies to those facts, the arguments presented in court, the decision the court has given and the reasons for the decision. The decision made by the judge normally appears towards the end of the judgment or decision.
    </p>
    <p>You may find that some judgments and decisions have reporting restrictions. In these cases the relevant parts of the judgment will have been redacted by the court.</p>
