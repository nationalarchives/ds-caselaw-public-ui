    <h2 id="section-search">How to search</h2>
    <p>
      You can search the full text of every judgment and decision. You can also search and browse judgments by neutral
      citation, court, party, judge and within a date range. These options can be combined on the
      <a href="{% url "structured_search" %}">{% translate "basicsearchform.structured_search" %}</a> page.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latest published judgments and decisions are listed on the <a href="{% url "home" %}">Find case law</a> page.
      Alternatively, you can browse
      by court and filter results.
    </p>
    <h3>Search the text of every judgment and decision</h3>
    <p>
      The search box on the <a href="{% url "home" %}">Find case law</a> page lets you search using any search term including
      a neutral citation, name(s) and keyword(s). This will search the full text of every judgment or decision we
      have.
    </p>
    <p>
      You do not need to do a Boolean search &ndash; spaces in between words will act as an 'and'. Results where the
      words are closest together will appear as the most relevant at the top of the search results.
    </p>
    <h3>Search specific fields</h3>
    <p>
      Alternatively, you can search using one or more specific search terms on the <a href="{% url "structured_search" %}">More search
      options</a> page. You can use multiple search fields at the same time to narrow down your results. The
      search boxes search particular fields. With the exception of keyword, these boxes do not search the full text of
      judgments and decisions.
    </p>
    <h4>Neutral citation</h4>
    <p>
      The courts allocate a 'neutral citation' to judgments and decisions. This is a unique number and reference. The
      neutral citation appears at the top of the judgment or decision, and is the official way to cite a judgment or
      decision.
    </p>
    <p>Examples of neutral citations include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>[2021] EWCA Civ 1847</li>
      <li>[2009] EWHC 2500 (Mercantile)</li>
      <li>[2021] EWCOP 18</li>
      <li>[2019] UKSC 38</li>
    </ul>
    <p>They typically include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The year the judgment or decision was handed down. For example: [2009]</li>
      <li>The standard court acronym. For example: EWCA is England and Wales Court of Appeal</li>
      <li>The standard acronym for the division of court. For example: Civ is Civil Division</li>
      <li>
        A unique number allocated by the individual court within a given year. For example: '1847' will be the
        unique number for the Court of Appeal Civil Division in 2021
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are struggling to find a judgment or decision using a neutral citation, first check:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You have written the neutral citation in full</li>
      <li>There are no typos or mistakes</li>
      <li>The spaces are in the appropriate places</li>
      <li>
        This is the neutral citation allocated by the court rather than the case number or a reference number issued
        by a publisher
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can also use neutral citations allocated by the British and Irish Legal Information Institute (BAILII) for
      judgments and decisions that do not have neutral citations allocated by the courts.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are confident that the neutral citation is correct but are struggling to find it, it may be that we don't
      have that judgment within our collection.

    </p>
    <h4>Party name</h4>
    <p>
      This is the name of someone involved in the case, such as the claimant or defendant. There are often multiple
      party names listed at the top of the judgment or decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use the 'party name' search field on the <a href="{% url "structured_search" %}">{% translate "basicsearchform.structured_search" %}</a> page to only search against judgments or
      decisions where the name is listed as a party. This will not search for the name within the text of all
      judgments and decisions.
    </p>
    <p>There may be multiple results if the name is listed as a party in multiple judgments or decisions.</p>
    <p>
      You can search using multiple party names at once. This means you can use this search to search by case name.
      The case name is made from some (or all) of the parties listed as the appellant and defendant.
    </p>
    <p>For example: Cape Intermediate Holdings Ltd v Dring.</p>
    <p>
      If you see a name that has been struck through on a judgment, this means that the person has withdrawn from the
      case before it was decided.
    </p>
    <h4>Keyword or phrase</h4>
    <p>You can search the full text of every judgment and decision using a specific word or short phrase.</p>
    <p>Spaces between words will act as an 'and'. Quotation marks will search using that exact phrase only.</p>
    <h4>Judge's name</h4>
    <p>The judge(s) who decided a case will appear at the top of the judgment or decision.</p>
    <p>
      You can search by the name of the judge who has decided a case by using the 'Judge's name' box on the
      <a href="{% url "structured_search" %}">{% translate "basicsearchform.structured_search" %}</a> page. This means that it will only search for judges that have given
      a judgment or decision on a case instead of searching every reference to the name of the judge within the full text of every judgment or
      decision.
    </p>
    <p>You can use a part of the name, the whole name, or the whole name and judicial titles.</p>
    <h4>Court/Chamber</h4>
    <p>The court or chamber where the case was decided will appear at the top of the judgment or decision.</p>
    <p>
      You can browse by court or chamber division to see all the judgments and decisions we have received from that
      court.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="{% translate "courtstructure.link" %}">Find out more about courts and tribunals</a>.
    </p>
    <h4>Date</h4>
    <p>The date the judgment or decision was handed down will appear at the top of the judgment or decision.</p>
    <p>You can search by date range to look for judgments and decisions within a particular time frame.</p>
    <h3>Search results</h3>
    <p>
      The search results are ordered by relevance. Judgments and decisions that contain the search terms within their
      'metadata' will be listed above other judgments that only contain the search terms within the full text of the
      judgment or decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Search terms found within the text will be ordered by how many times that search term is used and the proximity
      between each search term.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example: if you searched for ‘Jones theft’ then the judgments with ‘Jones’ listed as a party name or judge’s
      name will appear at the top of the search results, followed by judgments that contain 'Jones' and 'theft' within
      the text of the judgment.
    </p>
    <p>You can filter results by date range, courts/chamber, party name and judge’s name.</p>
    <h2 id="section-understanding">Understanding a judgment or decision</h2>
    <p>
      A judgment is the decision a court has made after hearing a case. Written judgments are also known as handed
      down
      judgments and can be very long.
    </p>
    <p>The National Archives does not provide summaries, interpretation or advice on any judgments or decisions.</p>
    <p>
      Every judgment or decision will start with a 'header' or title page which contains the important information
      about the judgment or decision, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Neutral citation</li>
      <li>Case number</li>
      <li>Court/chamber</li>
      <li>Judge's name(s)</li>
      <li>Party names</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The way the text of each judgment or decision is written is up to the judge. Typically, judgments will
      summarise
      'the facts' of the case, the law that applies to those facts, the arguments presented in court, the decision
      the
      court has given and the reasons for the decision. The decision made by the judge normally appears towards
      the
      end of the judgment or decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may find that some judgments and decisions have reporting restrictions. In these cases the relevant parts
      of
      the judgment will be obscured.
    </p>

  <h2 id="section-about">What is case law</h2>
  <p>
    Case law is the law which is created through court judgments and tribunal decisions. This is sometimes known as
    common law. Judges will follow the 'precedent' or the principles used in previous judgments and decisions when
    deciding on a case. Case law can be used to clarify legislation if it is unclear how it applies in a particular
    context.
  </p>
  <p>
    Legislation is law enacted by Parliament or made by the government, and is sometimes known as statute law.
    Visit the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk">legislation.gov.uk website</a> to find out more.
  </p>

    <li>The standard court acronym. For example: EWCA is England and Wales Court of Appeal</li>
    <li>The standard acronym for the division of court. For example: Civ is Civil Division</li>
    <li>
      A unique number allocated by the individual court within a given year. For example: '1847' will be the
      unique number for the Court of Appeal Civil Division in 2021

  </ul>
  <p>If you are struggling to find a judgment or decision using a neutral citation, first check:</p>
