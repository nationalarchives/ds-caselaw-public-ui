  <section>
    <h2>Fair and reasonable use</h2>
    <p>
      You must use the service responsibly by not making too many requests. In order to maintain the integrity
      of the service for everyone, we may block or disable use of the service from certain IP addresses, for
      making too many requests.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Crawling and indexing</h2>
    <p>You may access the Find Case Law service through the website, or access the data through the API.</p>
    <p>
      We do not permit external indexing of documents by search engine robots or spiders.
      You must adhere to both, the instructions in the robots.txt file at:
      <a href="{% translate "robots.link" %}">{% translate "robots.link" %}</a>
      and the 'noindex' directive in the 'X- Robots-Tag' meta tag
      HTTP header response for the URLs of all documents and their related assets.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may block or disable use of the service from certain IP addresses, if they appear to be compiling a
      search engine index.
    </p>

    <h2>Coverage</h2>
    <p>
      You should be aware that the Find Case Law service is incomplete. It is not a complete record of Court
      Judgments and Tribunal Decisions for the courts or tribunals.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should be aware that some judgments may subsequently have been appealed and the judgments on appeal
      may not be included in the Find Case Law service. You should satisfy yourself that a judgment has not
      been the subject of an appeal before relying on it as an authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should be aware that judgments given from 19 April 2022 onwards have been transferred to The National
      Archives directly by the courts and tribunals. We have a complete chain of custody for these records
      through the transfer process.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should be aware that judgments given prior to 19 April 2022 have been sourced by The National
      Archives from a variety of different sources, including BAILII (<a href="https://{% translate "bailii.link" %}">{% translate "bailii.link" %}</a>).

    <h2>Formats</h2>
    <p>
      The Find Case Law service has been designed to provide users with access to Court Judgments and Tribunal
      Decisions in a variety of different formats. The available formats include web pages (HTML) with
      hyperlinks, PDFs to download, and XML data for re-use by third parties. There is an API which provides
      access to the data, including details of newly published judgments and decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should be aware that, as part of our publishing process, we have transformed the original version of
      the judgment from (typically) Word into XML (the Legal Document Mark-up language) and PDF. We have used the XML
      to create the HTML versions of the judgments. We have also added hyperlinks. There may be minor formatting issues
      with the published version of the judgments as a result of the conversion and enrichment process.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Licensing</h2>
    <p>
      You may use and re-use the contents of the Find Case Law service under the terms of the
      <a href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/open-justice-licence">Open Justice Licence</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must read the licence and understand its terms if you are re-using the information from the Find Case
      Law service, as there are important conditions and exclusions that apply.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must apply for a separate, free, <a href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/transactional-licence-form">transactional licence</a> if you wish to conduct computational analysis of the
      information provided by the Find Case Law service. The application process is free of charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should contact us if you require bulk access to the data provided by the Find Case Law service,
      rather than attempt to crawl or scrape the website.
