<h3 id="search-term">Search term</h3>
<p>This component can be added to a page to enter a search term and perform a search.
  <strong>Note:</strong> it cannot be used outside of the search form as it relies on styling from that component</p>

  {% include "includes/search_term_component.html" with form=search_form %}
</div>

<p><strong>Usage:</strong></p>
