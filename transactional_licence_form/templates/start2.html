    <p>
      Are available for re-use under the<a href="{% url 'open_justice_licence' %}">terms of the Open Justice licence.</a>
      You do not need to apply if your re-use complies with these terms. However if you want to perform computational analysis then you will need to apply for an additional licence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Computational analysis includes activities such as: any programmatic searching in bulk across the Find Case Law records to identify, extract or enrich contents within the records.
    </p>
    <p>There are no costs to apply for a licence to perform computational analysis.</p>
    <h2 id="section-principles">Assessing applications to perform computational analysis</h2>
    <p>
      Licences for computational analysis are assessed based on the activities and re-use you state in your application. The licences we issue will be specific to your re-use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The licence team at The National Archives will assess your application against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_safes">the five safes framework</a>as well as the 9 principles established in 2023 by the Ministry of Justice:
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li>Dignity of the court</li>
        <li>Independence of the court</li>
        <li>Appropriate scrutiny</li>
        <li>Anti-discriminatory harm</li>
        <li>Anti-Bias</li>
        <li>Personal Privacy</li>
        <li>Discoverability</li>
        <li>Algorithmic transparency</li>
        <li>Accurate data representation</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Licence team will determine whether your re-use is high risk or not. They will use this to decide the type of licence you will receive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Activities currently considered high risk include:
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Whether you intend to produce fully automated legal advice.</li>
        <li>
          Whether you intend to perform automation to anticipate legal decisions directly for a client or consumer, such as tools which set expectations for case outcomes through modelling or predictive analytics.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whether you intend to directly inform or influence the decision of a third-party regarding whether to pursue justice or legal action.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Context is important when understanding risk. If you have an idea that you think might be high risk, please apply giving as much detail as you can.
    </p>
    <h2 id="section-licences">Two types of licence</h2>
    <p>Based on your application there are two main categories for licences we issue to perform computational analysis.</p>
    <ul style="list-style: none;">
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Research and Development</strong>
          <br>
          These licences are typically granted for 1 year where the purpose of re-using the data is to gain insight or develop new technologies or practices.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Transactional</strong>
          <br>
          These licences are typically granted for up to 5 years. These are for when computational analysis is necessary to deliver a commercial product or service and it is not high risk.
          <br>
          It is important to note that any licence we issue will not be :
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>a data sharing agreement for personal data</li>
            <li>a processing agreement for personal data</li>
          </ul>
          You should make sure that you comply with all relevant regulations.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In the interests of transparency, we consider the following risk factors during licence applications for computational analysis:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Whether you intend to produce fully automated legal advice.</li>
      <li>
        Whether you intend to perform automation to anticipate legal decisions directly for a client or consumer, such as tools which set
        expectations for case outcomes through modelling or predictive analytics.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whether you intend to directly inform or influence the decision of a third-party regarding whether to pursue justice or legal action.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We want you to know that licence application is not just about completing a form, it is a conversation. If you have an idea for
      computational analysis that you think might be high risk, please talk to us to see what options there are.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use the five safes framework to assess all applications for risk. You can read more about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_safes">Five safes on Wikipedia</a>
    </p>
    <h2 id="section-decisions">Approval process</h2>
    <p>
      Once your licence has been assessed by the licence team, your licence application will be reviewed by <a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/about/our-role/boards-and-advisory-groups/discovery-board/">Discovery board.</a>
      This is a cross-departmental board at The National Archives. The board meets once a month.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rarely,  applications will need to be reviewed by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/data-governance-panel-formed-to-improve-use-of-court-and-tribunals-data#:~:text=About%20the%20senior%20data%20governance%20panel&text=Its%20role%20is%20to%20advise,rule%20of%20law">Data Governance Panel</a> that meets 4 times a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will be updated on the status of your application. It may be a few weeks until you get a decision on your application.
    </p>
    <h2 id="section-published">Publication of approved licences</h2>
    <p>
      We keep a record of all applications. If your application is successful, part of your application may be made publicly available in the future. This will support transparency #
      in activities using computational analysis that have been approved under licence.
