        There is one application form to apply to perform computational analysis across Find Case Law records. It is made up of 5 main sections.
        You will need to respond to all the questions we ask. There is no way to save the application part way through.

            <strong>1. Dignity of the Courts</strong>
            <p>
              It is important that any analysis maintains the dignity of the courts and tribunals and does not undermine their functioning as working bodies. This is consistent with access to justice.

            <ol start="16">

                You should consider anything that may undermine the ability for the justice system to operate impartially and with integrity and treat all members of
                the public equally and fairly, no matter who they are.

            </ol>
            <strong>2. Independence of the Court</strong>

              We seek to encourage the analysis of machine-readable judgments to allow the public to scrutinise justice outcomes and the law more effectively.
              We also acknowledge that the incomplete nature of the dataset and the current lack of safeguard against opaque or biased methodologies increases the risk of inaccurate or biased conclusions which may cause harm to individuals named therein.

            <p>
                We acknowledge a distinction between publicly available and readily available information. For example, care should be given to data subjects’ discoverability in line
                with MoJ/The National Archives’ decision not to index the content of judgments on search engines.

                  <strong>9. Accurate data representation</strong>
                  <p>
                    The ‘Find Case Law’ service comprises an incomplete set of court judgments and tribunal decisions. Outcomes from analysis should therefore reflect the limitations of the data and avoid misrepresenting the significance of findings.

                        Occasionally records that have been published will be revised and taken down by the court. Licence holders must regularly check to make sure they are re-using the authoritative version of the record. Do you agree to this licence term?<br>
