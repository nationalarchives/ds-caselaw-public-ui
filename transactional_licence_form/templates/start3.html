          <p>
            In 2023 the Ministry of Justice established 9 principles to guide our decision making process on applications to conduct computational analysis across the Find Case Law collection. We will ask you to accept these as licence terms and to prepare a
            statement about any risks you have identified for each of these principles.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s important that you respond to each principle in turn. Responses that do not address each of the 9 principles may experience delays and requests for further information. Please read the information carefully. If you are unsure how to answer
            this question you can contact the licensing department for further information.

                  There are 9 principles that have been established by the Ministry of Justice. They form part of the terms of any licence we grant. You will need to read these principles carefully and explain in detail how you will meet these terms.
                  The 9 principles are:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Dignity of the Court</li>
                  <li>Independence of the Court</li>

                </ol>
                <strong>1. Dignity of the Courts</strong>
                <p>
                  It is important that any analysis maintains the dignity of the courts and tribunals and does not undermine their functioning as working bodies. This is consistent with access to justice.
                </p>
                <p>Licence holders must not undermine the courts and tribunals’ ability to function as working bodies.</p>
                <p>
                  You should consider anything that may undermine the ability for the justice system to operate impartially and with integrity and treat all members of the public equally and fairly,
                  no matter who they are
                </p>
                <strong>2. Independence of the Court</strong>
                <p>It is important that any analysis respects the independence of the judiciary and their impartial judgment.</p>
                <p>Licence holders must respect the independence of the judiciary.</p>
                <p>
                  You should consider anything that may undermine the ability for the justice system to be fair and transparent, free of any influence outside the rule of law.
                </p>
                <strong>3. Appropriate Scrutiny</strong>
                <p>
                  We seek to encourage the analysis of machine-readable judgments to allow the public to scrutinise justice outcomes and the law more effectively. We also acknowledge that the incomplete nature of the
                  dataset and the current lack of safeguard against opaque or biased
                  methodologies increases the risk of inaccurate or biased conclusions which may cause harm to individuals named therein.
                </p>
                <p>Licence holders must acknowledge the incomplete nature of the dataset and apply appropriate scrutiny</p>
                <p>
                  You should consider how you will prevent anonymised people from being identified. This is referred to as jigsaw identification - putting together information in a way that identifies individuals even if they have been anonymised.
                </p>
                <strong>4. Anti-discriminatory harm</strong>
                <p>
                  Outcomes of analysis should not cause direct discriminatory harm and reasonable steps should be taken by the licence holder to avoid introducing or compounding bias. Licence holders must take actions to prevent discriminatory harm
                </p>
                <p>
                  You should consider how you will monitor for and address harmful outcomes including misleading analysis or conclusions and discrimination against individuals or communities.
                </p>
                <strong>5. Anti-bias</strong>
                <p>
                  Licence holders have a responsibility to operate effective governance to ensure that bias does not enter the process over time.
                </p>
                <p>Licence holders must ensure bias does not enter their process over time</p>
                <p>You should consider any ethical governance structures you have in place.</p>
                <strong>6. Personal privacy</strong>
                <p>
                  Re-users should satisfy themselves that their practices comply with the standards set out in the DPA and UK GDPR regarding data security and data subjects’ rights, regardless of their location.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Please note that this licence:
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>is not a data sharing agreement for personal data</li>
                    <li>is not a processing agreement for personal data</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <strong>7. Discoverability</strong>
                <p>
                  We acknowledge a distinction between publicly available and readily available information. For example, care should be given to data subjects’ discoverability in line with
                  Ministry of Justice/The National Archives’ decision not to index the content of judgments on search engines.
                </p>
                <p>Licence holders must not index the contents of judgments and decisions on search engines.</p>
                <p>
                  You should consider what you will do to prevent third party services from crawling or scraping either the text of the records or the data you have extracted from the records.
                </p>
                <strong>8.Algorithmic transparency</strong>
                <p>Where possible, algorithms should be explainable and transparent.</p>
                <p>
                  You should consider how you will be transparent in your use of algorithms to people using your project or product.
                </p>
                <strong>9. Accurate data representation</strong>
                <p>
                  The Find Case Law service comprises an incomplete set of court judgments and tribunal decisions.  Outcomes from analysis should therefore reflect the limitations of the
                  data and avoid misrepresenting the significance of findings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Licence holders must avoid misrepresenting the significance of findings
                  Occasionally records that have been published will be revised and taken down by the court. Licence holders must regularly check to make sure they are re-using the authoritative version of the record
                </p>
                <p>
                  You should consider how you will make sure the records you use are the most up to date published version of the records.

                  </p>
                  <strong>Dignity of the courts</strong>
                  <p>
                    We respect the courts as working bodies and will not denigrate or undermine the work of the court. We respect the courts as working bodies and will not denigrate or undermine the work of the court.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We make sure our tool respects the importance of the courts and does not undermine their work by meticulously checking for accuracy and fairness. We will be transparent in our sources and follow legal ethical standards in order to support the court as functioning bodies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We have quality control measures in place that make sure our summaries are consistent and reflect the formal language used by the courts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our legal editorial team will check all summaries to avoid misrepresentation and reflect the solemnity of court proceedings.
                  </p>
                  <strong>Independence of the court</strong>
                  <p>
                    We respect the independence of the judiciary and uphold their impartial judgment by checking and correcting our summaries for bias or partiality. The summaries are designed to succinctly lay out the decision the court made without subjective interpretation.
                    We review and refine our summaries against legal ethical standards.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We believe it is important for judges to make decisions free from fear or favour and will not seek to manipulate judicial decision making with our HR summary service. It is important that our users trust that our summaries of decisions made on employment matters are objective.
                  </p>
                  <strong>Appropriate scrutiny</strong>
                  <p>
                    We acknowledge there is potential for biased conclusions to be drawn from an incomplete dataset. We use robust validation techniques that involve our legal experts in our review process to make sure our summaries are reliable. We conduct regular audits and
                    evaluations to make sure our outputs are appropriate and accurate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We will notify our users that our summaries are trained on available datasets that may not be representative of all decisions made.
                  </p>
                  <strong>Anti-discriminatory Harm</strong>
                  <p>
                    We are committed to preventing any form of discriminatory harm. Our algorithms will be monitored for bias against race, gender, ethnicity, religion, age, disability or other protected characteristics. We will conduct regular testing across our outputs to make
                    sure the tool works equitably across all cases.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We will support users to leave feedback on the service. Any reported discriminatory outputs would immediately trigger a thorough investigation. The reported summary would be temporarily taken down during the investigation while we identify and address the issue. We would then re-evaluate
                    our algorithms and data sets by conducting a risk assessment that identifies actions to reduce the likelihood of future occurrences.
                  </p>
                  <strong>Anti-bias</strong>
                  <p>
                    To prevent bias we train our tool on a diverse and representative dataset. Our legal editorial team reviews the outputs and helps train our model to recognise and avoid biased summaries. We continually monitor our summaries for any emerging bias or misrepresentation.Any anomalies that
                    are identified would trigger a thorough investigation to understand the cause and address it.
                  </p>
                  <strong>Personal privacy</strong>
                  <p>
                    We adhere to data protection regulations in the UK and EU. We are satisfied that we meet the requirements of these regulations. All names of individuals mentioned in cases will be anonymised before processing. We do not share access to raw data with third parties for processing.
                  </p>
                  <strong>Discoverability</strong>
                  <p>
                    Our tool will be designed to support the discoverability of cases for HR officials.  We will index the case name and categorisation of the summary but not the body of the judgment in order to protect the identities of others cited in the case. While our content will be
                    easily discoverable online, users will be asked to sign after reading the first paragraph of the summary. On their account users curate the type of case they want to see by area of employment law.
                  </p>
                  <strong>Algorithmic transparency</strong>
                  <p>
                    We provide clear explanations of our methodologies on our website so that users can understand how we create our summaries. In addition we publish transparency reports annually in order to maintain our accountability.
                  </p>
                  <strong>Accurate Data Representation</strong>
                  <p>
                    Accurate data representation is important to the accuracy of our summaries. We regularly check our training datasets are up to date with the latest cases and remove decisions that  have been taken down from the Find Case Law service under the instruction of the courts.
                    Our tool uses Natural Language Processing to summarise court decisions without interpretation or distortion.  We clearly label our summaries as automatically produced summaries and signpost users to the full judgment. We warn users that our service does not offer legal advice. Documentation about the datasets we use and how we have developed the tool is available to our users on our website.
