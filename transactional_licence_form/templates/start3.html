            <strong>Dignity of the Courts</strong>
            <p>
              It is important that any analysis maintains the dignity of the courts and tribunals and does not undermine their functioning as working bodies. This is consistent with access to justice.

            <ol start="16">

                the public equally and fairly, no matter who they are.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <strong>Independence of the Court</strong>

            </ol>
            <strong>Appropriate Scrutiny</strong>
            <p>
              We seek to encourage the analysis of machine-readable judgments to allow the public to scrutinise justice outcomes and the law more effectively.
              We also acknowledge that the incomplete nature of the dataset and the current lack of safeguard against opaque or biased methodologies increases the risk of inaccurate or biased conclusions which may cause harm to individuals named therein.
