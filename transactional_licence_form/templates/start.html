    <h2>Open Justice licence</h2>
    <p>
      The National Archives, in collaboration with The Ministry of Justice and the Judicial Executive Board, have worked together to design a new licensing framework for the reuse
      of case law as data. The Open Justice licence is designed to protect the personal data within the records while supporting the principles of Open Justice. You can <a href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/about-this-service#section-reuse">more about how we protect personal data here.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Open Justice licence allows you to copy, publish, distribute and transmit case law data. It permits you to use the data commercially, for example, by combining it with other information, or by including it in your own product or application.
      There are certain conditions that apply under this licence.
