      Open justice is a fundamental principle at the heart of the justice system - justice must not only be done, but it must also be seen to be done.
      Access to judgments and decisions as data supports the principles of open justice by fostering transparency and promoting innovation in legal technology
      and legal research. We have converted the judgments and decisions we hold into XML format, and made them freely available via the
      <a href="https://github.com/nationalarchives/ds-find-caselaw-docs/blob/main/doc/openapi/public_api.yml">

    <h3>You need a licence to reuse case law data</h3>
    <p>
      The National Archives, in collaboration with The Ministry of Justice and the Judicial Executive Board, have worked together to design a new licensing
      framework for the reuse of case law as data. All licences are free but you may need to apply for a specific licence, depending on your reuse of the data.

      <div class="info-box__content">
        <p>
          Under this licence you can copy, publish, distribute and transmit case law data, and use the data commercially, for example, by combining it with other information,
          or by including it in your own product or application, all with certain conditions.

        <p>You can operate under the Open Justice Licence without needing to apply for one.</p>
