      Free access to and re-use of judgments and decisions is fundamental to the principles of Open Justice and supports innovation in legal research and technology. Our repository of judgments and decisions can be freely accessed and re-used under the Open Justice Licence.

    <h2 id="section-licence">Open Justice licence</h2>
    <p>
      The National Archives, has worked in collaboration with The Ministry of Justice and the Judicial Executive Board to design a new licensing framework for the reuse
      of case law as data. The Open Justice licence is designed to protect the personal data within the records while supporting the principles of Open Justice. Find out more about <a href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/privacy-notice">how we protect personal data</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Open Justice licence allows you to copy, publish, distribute and transmit case law data. It permits you to use the data commercially, for example, by combining it with other information, or by including it in your own product or application.
      There are certain conditions that apply under this licence.
