            <p style="text-align:justify">This is an appeal by Ms Rogers from an order made by the Administrative Court (Bean J) dismissing her application for judicial review of Swindon Primary Care Trust’s decision, refusing her application for funding in respect of treatment with a drug called Herceptin. Ms Rogers has primary breast cancer, for the treatment of which she was prescribed Herceptin. The Primary Care Trust decided, in accordance with its policy with respect to Herceptin, that she was not entitled to funding. The Administrative Court decided that this decision was not irrational and did not breach her human rights.</p>

The Court of Appeal will order that the Primary Care Trust’s decision be quashed.  See further under CONCLUSION below.</p>

The PCT’s general policy</span> (paras 18-25) describes the Primary Care Trust’s usual policy with respect to the funding of drugs which are prescribed ‘off-licence’ and are unapproved by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (“NICE”).  It will not fund such drugs except where a patient has a special healthcare problem that presents an exceptional case for treatment, when it will consider each case on its merits having regard to the funds available.</p>

The policy was to fund Herceptin, without regard to financial considerations, in those cases where Herceptin was prescribed by a clinician and where it was decided that there were exceptional clinical or personal circumstances.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="text-decoration:underline">IX. The relevant principles of common law</span> (paras 55-66) considers the leading cases dealing with challenges to healthcare providers’ funding decisions on the grounds of irrationality.  It also identifies the key issue in this case as being whether the underlying policy, rather than the particular decision in Ms Rogers’ case, is unlawful.  The court concludes in para 66 that, if the policy is lawful, so too is the decision but, if the policy is unlawful, so too is the decision.</p>

          <content>
            <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="text-decoration:underline">X. Rationality</span> (paras 67-82) addresses the rationality of the policy adopted by the Primary Care Trust, as set out in VI above.  It notes that the Trust had recognised that Herceptin could be provided in "exceptional" cases even though NICE had not approved it, and had also decided to disregard financial considerations.   But in considering what might be such an exceptional case, 'personal circumstances' are irrelevant as soon as financial considerations are disregarded, and the Trust was unable to identify any 'clinical circumstances' that might provide a rational justification for distinguishing between different members of the eligible group.  The stated policy was thus not capable of being rationally explained, and therefore was unlawful, as was the decision in Ms Rogers' case that applied that policy.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="text-decoration:underline">XI. CONCLUSION</span> (paras 83-84) sets out the court’s conclusion that the policy and therefore the decision applying the policy was unlawful and should be quashed.  Subject to further submissions, the court expresses its present view that it cannot and should not order the PCT to fund Ms Rogers’ treatment.  Rather it is for the PCT to formulate a lawful policy upon which to base decisions in particular cases, including that of Ms Rogers, in the future.</p>

In this appeal, which is brought with the permission of the judge, she says that the PCT’s refusal was unlawful on the ground that it was arbitrary or irrational and in the relevant sense unreasonable and/or that it involved a failure to give proper consideration to the relevant facts and/or that it infringed her rights under article 2 and/or 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights (“the Convention”).  In granting permission to appeal the judge said that the case raises issues of public interest and importance which should be considered by the Court of Appeal.</p>

The appellant is 54 and lives in Swindon.  She has three adult children and two young grandchildren.  Prior to her diagnosis of breast cancer she had run the restaurant side of her sister’s public house but since her treatment has been unable to carry on working.  She first noticed a lump in her breast in October 2004.  She went to her general practitioner the following day and was given an appointment for a mammogram at her local hospital in Swindon which was conducted on 24 November 2004.  The mammogram result was initially thought to be normal but subsequent biopsies revealed invasive carcinoma.  </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In January 2005 the appellant underwent a mastectomy, breast reconstruction and auxiliary surgery.  Following a period of recovery from this surgery she commenced chemotherapy in March 2005.  This course of chemotherapy lasted until 4 July 2005.  She found the treatment very difficult due to its gruelling side-effects.  Following the course of chemotherapy she embarked on a course of radiotherapy at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford in August and September 2005.  At this time she also had adjuvant hormone therapy. </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the meantime the appellant’s son had discovered on the internet that there was a type of breast cancer known as HER2 positive which could be treated by a drug called Herceptin.  Towards the end of her chemotherapy she accordingly asked her consultant, Dr Cole, if she could be tested for HER2 and on 30 June 2005 was tested positive.  In August 2005 Dr Cole wrote to the medical director of the Swindon and Marlborough NHS Trust informing him of the “exciting” results of the Herceptin trials that had been presented to the American Society of Oncology in May 2005 and asked whether Ms Rogers could pay for Herceptin whilst remaining an NHS patient.  The answer was that she could not.  In due course Dr Cole agreed to treat the appellant with Herceptin on a private basis and on 27 October 2005 began treatment at the Ridgeway Hospital, Swindon.  Although she had to pay for the drug she did not have to pay for the medical input because Dr Cole waived his fees. </p>

The estimated cost (including VAT) of the course of treatment was £26,328.22, which the appellant was unable to pay.  She borrowed £5,000 from which she paid for her first two treatments each of which cost £1,950.  She could not afford to pay for a third treatment.  She had originally hoped to re-mortgage her house to pay for the course of treatment but, given her diagnosis, she was unable to do so.  </p>

The response, the same day, was that, although Herceptin is not prescribed by the NHS in the Swindon area, the PCT would review each individual case<span style="font-style:italic">.  </span>Dr Cole duly applied to the Defendant PCT for funding for the appellant’s Herceptin treatment but her application was rejected.

In his order of 15 February Bean J ordered that the interim order for treatment and funding continue until the end of March 2006.

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Breast cancer can occur in a number of forms, including ‘HER2-positive’ breast cancer.  HER2 is a protein found on the surface of certain cancer cells. It is made by a specific gene called the <span class="Emphasis" style="font-style:normal">HER2/neu gene</span>.  HER2 is a receptor for a particular growth factor called human epidermal growth factor, which occurs naturally in the body. When <span class="Emphasis" style="font-style:normal">human epidermal growth factor</span> attaches itself to HER2 receptors on breast cancer cells, it can stimulate the cells to divide and grow.  Some breast cancer cells have far more HER2 receptors than others. In this case, the tumour is described as being <span class="Emphasis" style="font-style:normal">HER2-positive</span>. It is thought that about one in five women with breast cancer will have HER2-positive tumours.  </p>

A drug called trastuzumab has been developed to be effective against HER2-positive breast cancer. It is a type of <span class="Emphasis" style="font-style:normal">monoclonal antibody</span>.  Monoclonal antibodies are treatments that can target particular proteins within the body.  An HER2 test can assess whether a particular cancer has a specific receptor on the surface of the cancer cells.  Trastuzumab attaches itself to the HER2 protein and stops human epidermal growth factor from reaching the breast cancer cells and stimulating their growth.  Trastuzumab only works in people who have high levels of the HER2 protein. </p>

Herceptin was licensed to treat secondary or late stage breast cancer in March 2002 but is not at present licensed for the treatment of early stage breast cancer.  The manufacturer has first to obtain a licence from the European Medicines Agency (“EMEA”).  We understand that an application was made to the EMEA on 17 February 2006.  In the meantime the Secretary of State for Health, the Rt Hon Patricia Hewitt MP, (“the Secretary of State”) had asked the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (“NICE”) to expedite its appraisal of the drug so that it can give appropriate guidance to PCTs without delay if and when it is licensed.  NICE is responsible for providing national guidance on treatments and care in the UK.  On 1 March the Secretary of State announced to the House of Commons that a decision by the EMEA is expected in the summer and that NICE would complete its work shortly after any licence is granted.  NICE technology appraisals are covered by a three-month funding direction, which means that trusts must provide funding for uses recommended by NICE within three months to allow clinicians to follow its guidance. </p>

Results were first presented to the annual meeting of the American Society of Oncology in May 2005 and were published in two papers in the New England Journal of Medicine (“NEJM”) on 20 October 2005.  According to Dr Murray Brunt, a consultant clinical oncologist whose report was part of the evidence before the judge, the trials showed significant benefits to those patients who had been given Herceptin.  Dr Brunt however recognises the potential cardiac side effects of Herceptin and notes that in one set of the trials, of the 1694 patients who received the drug for a one-year course of treatment, nine developed severe congestive heart failure although there were no deaths.   </p>

The amount of HER2 protein in the cancer cells is measured using a scale from 0 (negative) to 3+ (strongly positive).  Women whose cancer scores 0 or 1+ are not likely to benefit from Herceptin treatment, so no further tests are required in order to see whether treatment is appropriate.  Patients with an HER2 score of 2 to 3 require an additional test (FISH/IHC) to establish whether or not they might benefit from treatment.  Patients with an HER2 score of 3+ will potentially benefit from Herceptin and no further test is required.  Thus in order to be part of the eligible group a patient must have an HER2 score of 2 to 3 and satisfy the FISH/IHC test or have an HER2 score of 3 and in addition satisfy the NCRI criteria.  It is not in dispute that the appellant had an HER2 score of 3+ or that she satisfies the NCRI criteria and that she is within the eligible group.</p>

The judge correctly described the position in paragraphs 19 to 23 of his judgment.  When reaching decisions in relation to the commissioning of pharmaceuticals, the PCT has two main sources of guidance. The first is NICE and the second is the Swindon Clinical Advisory Forum (“CAF”), a committee which includes both representatives of the NHS agencies providing services to Swindon residents and Patient Forum representation.  The role of CAF is to review evidence in order to formulate clear health and healthcare priorities and to develop a coherent system for their implementation.  In doing so, CAF looks at the absolute merits of a prospective treatment and also its relative merits judged against other priorities.  The CAF makes recommendations to the Trust’s Professional Executive Committee, which is a sub-committee of the Board.  </p>

For example, there are drugs used in paediatric medicine, many of which are widely used, which have a long safety record and are licensed for adult use but have not been licensed for child use, possibly, as the judge put it, because of the ethical and practical difficulties in carrying out trials of medicines on children.  Those are exceptions to the general rule.  “Off-licence” funding or treatment is the convenient term used to identify such cases and such drugs are often referred to as “off-licence” drugs.</p>

The drug is already licensed and approved for late stage breast cancer but not for early breast cancer.  There are some concerns amongst clinicians that it can cause serious cardiac problems for a small number of women who take it.  And yet the early evidence suggests that it can be extremely effective for some early stage cancers which is why it has been fast tracked to NICE.  I know that patients and clinicians alike will have seen the evidence presented recently in the New England Journal and will be very keen as patients to discuss the potential benefits of the drug.</p>

The third paragraph is a statement by the Chief Executive.  No distinction has however been drawn between the three paragraphs.  It is common ground that they were all intended to be part of an official communication by the Secretary of State to the PCT and other trusts. There was an issue before the judge to as to whether it amounted to a direction which the trusts must follow or simply guidance to which they must have regard.  The judge held that it was guidance and it is common ground before us that he was correct so to hold.  It follows that it is common ground that it was the duty of the PCT to have regard to the guidance contained in the bulletin.  There was some discussion in argument as to the meaning of the guidance issued by the Secretary of State, to which we return below. </p>

The full text of the speech was not distributed to the PCT and other trusts.  Like the judge, we were referred to evidence which the Secretary of State gave to the House of Commons Select Committee on Health on 6 December 2005, which was very much on the lines of her 25 October 2005 speech.  Again, it is common ground that what she said then cannot constitute guidance, let alone a direction.</p>

Both Ms Lee and Ms Leaman say that in effect the decision made was that the PCT would not treat Herceptin as an exception to its general policy that it does not fund unlicensed drugs.

Thus it is not said that the PCT decided, either wholly or partly for budgetary or financial reasons, not to fund Herceptin treatment save in exceptional cases.

Before addressing that question, we should refer to the decision made in the case of the appellant.  We can do so comparatively shortly (based on paragraphs 33 to 46 of the judgment) because it is not in dispute that the decision followed from the policy.  As appears below it seems to us to follow that if the policy was unlawful, so was the decision and, if the policy was lawful, so too was the decision. </p>

They wrote on 22 November 2005 stating that, if the PCT did not fund appropriate health care treatment, and in particular, a course of Herceptin, they would apply for judicial review.  Ms Leaman responded by letter on the same date setting out the PCT’s position in relation to Herceptin as summarised above.  She added that, although there had been no application on the appellant’s behalf for exceptional funding, she would contact Dr Cole, who was the oncologist treating the appellant.</p>

It also wrote to the appellant to inform her of the action proposed.  Dr Janson responded to the PCT’s request for information by a letter dated 29 November 2005 setting out in brief the background to the Claimant’s condition.  The letter stated that she had borrowed money from her sister for earlier treatments and would have to mortgage her house to continue with the course. </p>

He added that it was not possible to define in advance what grounds might be considered exceptional and emphasised that PCTs should not refuse such requests simply on the grounds of the cost implications. </p>

It is natural that each authority, in establishing its own priorities, will give greater priority to life-threatening and other grave illnesses than to others obviously less demanding of medical intervention. The precise allocation and weighting of priorities is clearly a matter of judgment for each authority, keeping well in mind its statutory obligations to meet the reasonable requirements of all those within its area for which it is responsible. It makes sense to have a policy for the purpose - indeed, it might well be irrational not to have one - and it makes sense too that, in settling on such a policy, an authority would normally place treatment of transsexualism lower in its scale of priorities than, say, cancer or heart disease or kidney failure. Authorities might reasonably differ as to precisely where in the scale transsexualism should be placed and as to the criteria for determining the appropriateness and need for treatment of it in individual cases. It is proper for an authority to adopt a general policy for the exercise of such an administrative discretion, to allow for exceptions from it in "exceptional circumstances" and to leave those circumstances undefined: see </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">In re Findlay</span><span style="color:#000000"> [1985] A.C. 318, 335-336, </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">per</span><span style="color:#000000"> Lord Scarman. In my view, a policy to place transsexualism low in an order of priorities of illnesses for treatment and to deny it treatment save in exceptional circumstances such as overriding clinical need is not in principle irrational, provided that the policy genuinely recognises the possibility of there being an overriding clinical need and requires each request for treatment to be considered on its individual merits.</span>”</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge observed in paragraph 63 of his judgment that the Court of Appeal was there considering North West Lancashire’s policy on the prioritisation of treatment because of scarcity of resources.  He said that in that context it was to be noted that, as most people would expect, it gave the treatment of cancer as an obvious example of a top priority.  However, he accepted a submission made by Mr Havers that the same principle applies to a policy based on the absence of regulatory approval.  He concluded that to decide that unlicensed use would not be funded save in undefined exceptional circumstances was not of itself unlawful.</p>

In it Auld LJ stresses that a policy which allows for exceptions in undefined exceptional circumstances is not unlawful “provided that <span style="color:#000000">the policy genuinely recognises the possibility of there being an overriding clinical need and requires each request for treatment to be considered on its individual merits.</span>”  As we see it, that means that a policy of withholding assistance save in unstated exceptional circumstances (in the case addressed by Auld LJ, and no doubt in this case also, overriding clinical need) will be rational in the legal sense provided that it is possible to envisage, and the decision-maker does envisage, what such exceptional circumstances might be.  If it is not possible to envisage any such circumstances, then the policy will be in practice a complete refusal of assistance: and irrational as such because it is sought to be justified not as a complete refusal but as a policy of exceptionality. </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus we would not hold that the policy was arbitrary because it refers to unidentified exceptional circumstances.  The essential question is whether the policy was rational; and, in deciding whether it is rational or not, the court must consider whether there are any relevant exceptional circumstances which could justify the PCT refusing treatment to one woman within the eligible group but granting it to another. And to anticipate, the difficulty that the PCT encounters in the present case is that while the policy is stated to be one of exceptionality, no persuasive grounds can be identified, at least in clinical terms, for treating one patient who fulfils the clinical requirements for Herceptin treatment differently from others in that cohort.  </p>

The same applies to any other condition caused by transsexualism such as a mental illness of the seriousness described by Dr Sudell.  If the authority considers the cause of such a condition to be untreatable by hormonal treatment and surgery, it is hard to see how it could regard the condition itself as an overriding need for such treatment.</p>

The policy involves asking whether there are exceptional circumstances in the case of any particular patient.  If that policy is lawful, we can see no basis for criticising the decision to refuse treatment to the appellant.  She is one of the eligible group and there is no basis for saying that her circumstances are exceptional by comparison with others in the group.  Both Dr Cole and Dr Janson said precisely that.  Dr Cole does not therefore complain about the particular decision but about the policy.  </p>

This appeal is not concerned with that policy because, again as set out above, the PCT did not follow its ordinary policy but a somewhat different policy which had regard to the Secretary of State’s guidance without wholly following it.  In these circumstances the rationality of the general policy is not in issue in this appeal.  We simply note in passing that, as we indicated earlier, in our opinion that policy is not irrational.  It involves taking account of a number of relevant circumstances, including the fact that the particular drug is off-licence and not approved by NICE, the special healthcare problems of the particular patient and financial considerations.  </p>

Thus Mr Havers submitted as follows.  The starting point is the fact that Herceptin is neither licensed by EMEA nor approved by NICE.  The system of licensing and approval is central to the way in which the prescription of drugs is administered in the NHS.  As Ms Lee puts it in her statement referred to in paragraph 35 above, it is wrong to introduce what she describes as a dangerous precedent of disregarding the contribution made by the licensing and appraisal process.  Moreover, as Ms Lee says, there are concerns about the research upon which those who prescribe Herceptin rely.  Thus a policy not to fund Herceptin save in exceptional circumstances, where a patient can show that there are exceptional personal or clinical circumstances in her case, is a cautious approach which is entirely rational.</p>

However, it was not that policy that the PCT followed.  The PCT did not adopt a policy of refusing to fund Herceptin treatment on the ground that it was not licensed by the EMEA or approved by NICE, and thus did not adopt the reasoning in the passage from the statement of Ms Lee quoted above.  Contrary to that statement, the PCT did not conclude that it would be irresponsible to introduce this drug in advance of licensing and NICE appraisal.  If it had, it would not have admitted the possibility of funding Herceptin treatment for a woman in exceptional personal or clinical circumstances.  It would simply have refused to do so on the ground that, if it did, it would be acting irresponsibly.

A fair reading of the guidance does provide some encouragement to trusts to fund Herceptin.  It emphasises the role of the individual clinician by saying that it is down to him or her to decide whether to prescribe Herceptin after discussions with the patient about potential risks and taking into account her medical history.  In addition to saying that trusts should not refuse funding solely on the ground of cost, it expressly provides that trusts should not rule out treatment in principle but should consider individual circumstances.  Thus a trust which complies with the guidance (as the PCT sought to do) cannot refuse to fund treatment simply on the basis that Herceptin is unlicensed and unapproved by NICE.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Havers submits that the Secretary of State did not say that Herceptin should be routinely prescribed and that she could easily have done so if that was what she had intended.  There is some forensic force in this point but it seems to us to overlook the relevance or potential relevance of funding considerations.  As already stated, the Secretary of State indicated that an application for funding should not be refused solely on the ground of cost but she did not say (or in our view mean to say) that considerations of cost were irrelevant.  In these circumstances the Secretary of State was not saying that Herceptin prescribed by a clinician should be routinely funded.  </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As we see it, she was stressing the potential value of Herceptin while recognising its possible risks and emphasising that it was down to the clinician to decide whether to prescribe Herceptin in consultation with the patient.  It was then for the trust to decide whether to fund the treatment, its decision to be taken, not solely on the basis of cost or by ruling it out in principle, but having regard to individual circumstances.  This left the trust to take account of the fact that the clinician had prescribed Herceptin notwithstanding that it was off-licence and not approved by NICE, and to balance cost considerations against the individual circumstances of the patient.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">We see nothing arbitrary or irrational about that approach.  It could properly involve a decision by a trust which was subject to financial constraints and which decided that it could not fund all the patients who applied for funding for Herceptin treatment, to make the difficult choice to fund treatment for a woman with, say, a disabled child and not for a woman in different personal circumstances.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">That is not however this case because the PCT developed a policy which treated financial considerations as irrelevant.  It thus had funds available for all women within the eligible group whose clinician prescribed Herceptin.  Yet its policy is to refuse funding save where exceptional personal or clinical circumstances can be shown.  </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Havers was naturally asked to give examples of personal circumstances which might justify funding one woman rather than another within the eligible group.  He submitted that it was not necessary for the PCT to identify possible examples and relied upon the <span style="font-style:italic">North West Lancashire Health Authority</span> case.  The only positive example he gave was that of a woman with a child with a life-limiting condition.  For our part, we cannot see how that fact can possibly justify providing funding for that woman but not another when each falls within the eligible group and there are available funds for both.  After all, once financial considerations are ruled out, and it has been decided not to rely on NICE without exception, then the only concern which the PCT can have must relate to the legitimate clinical needs of the patient.  The non-medical personal situation of a particular patient cannot in these circumstances be relevant to the question whether Herceptin prescribed by the patient’s clinician should be funded for the benefit of the patient.  Where the clinical needs are equal, and resources are not an issue, discrimination between patients in the same eligible group cannot be justified on the basis of personal characteristics not based on healthcare.              </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to clinical characteristics, it was suggested in argument that one woman in the eligible group might have a greater clinical need for Herceptin than another.  We can see that that might be theoretically possible but there is no indication that any such possibility in fact exists.  The PCT rejected the suggestion that a distinction might be made between one person within the group and another on the ground that the prognosis of each was different.  As we understand it, that was on the basis that the research does not support such an approach.  It was also suggested that one patient within the group might be unable for medical reasons to take another drug such as tamoxifen, whereas the rest of the group might be able to take it, and that such a case would be an example of an exceptional circumstance upon which a decision to fund Herceptin treatment for the former patient and not for the rest could be justified.  There is, however, no evidence which supports such a possibility.  In any event we accept Mr Pannick’s submission that it could not be reasonable or rational to deny a patient Herceptin treatment because she can tolerate tamoxifen, where there is no evidence that tamoxifen, or any other drug, is an alternative to Herceptin. </p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">All the clinical evidence is to the same effect.  The PCT has not put any clinical or medical evidence before the court to suggest any such clinical distinction could be made.  In these circumstances there is no rational basis for distinguishing between patients within the eligible group on the basis of exceptional clinical circumstances any more than on the basis of personal, let alone social, circumstances.  In short, we accept Mr Pannick’s submission that once the PCT decided (as it did) that it would fund Herceptin for some patients and that cost was irrelevant, the only reasonable approach was to focus on the patient’s clinical needs and fund patients within the eligible group who were properly prescribed Herceptin by their physician.  This would not open the floodgates to those suffering from breast cancer because only comparatively few satisfy the criteria so as to qualify for the eligible group.          </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For these reasons we have reached the conclusion that the policy of the PCT is irrational, unless it can properly be said that it is not necessary to identify individual characteristics which might justify distinguishing between one patient within the eligible group and another.  In our judgement, that cannot properly be said and the <span style="font-style:italic">North West Lancashire Hospital Authority </span>case is not authority to the contrary.  In that case the court emphasised the importance of the policy genuinely recognising the possibility of there being an overriding clinical need.  Here the evidence does not establish the possibility of there being relevant clinical circumstances relating to one patient and not another and, in the case of personal characteristics, there is no rational basis for preferring one patient to another.</p>

In these circumstances it is not necessary for us to consider the other bases on which the appellant seeks to challenge the PCT’s refusal to fund the treatment.  In particular it is not necessary for us to consider the possible impact of article 2 and/or 14 of the Convention.  We will not further lengthen this judgment by doing so.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It follows that the decision of the PCT to refuse to fund the treatment of the appellant with Herceptin in accordance with Dr Cole’s recommendation must be quashed.  Although we will hear further submissions on the point, it is our present view that we cannot and should not order the PCT to fund the treatment.  As we see it, it is now a matter for the PCT to reconsider its policy and to formulate a lawful policy upon which to base decisions in particular cases, including that of the appellant, in the future. </p>
