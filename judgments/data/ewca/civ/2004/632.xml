            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This is an appeal in an action arising out of a dispute which has arisen between members of the extended family of Chunil Bharmal Shah (“C. B. Shah”), who died in 1984.   C. B. Shah had twelve children – six sons and six daughters – all of whom survived him.   The six sons (in order of age) were: Gulabchand, Ratilal, Rajnikant, Tarachand, Ramesh, and Shantilal.<span style="color:#FF0000">   </span>Three of the sons have since died, namely Gulabchand, who died on 29 June 1970; Rajnikant, who died on 7 October 2000; and Shantilal, who died on 18 May 2002.   Gulabchand left two children: a son, Jatin, and a daughter Mrs Sangeeta Mehra (“Sangeeta”).   Rajnikant left a widow, Radiatben, and three children including a son, Punit.    Shantilal left a widow, Priti, but no children.     The six daughters, all of whom are living, are (in order of age) Sumati, Hansa, Sushila, Anjna, Damianti and Panna.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The action was commenced on 1 February 2002.   Sangeeta is the claimant.    The thirteen defendants are C. B. Shah’s nine surviving children, together with Radiatben, Punit, Priti and Kasturben (Ratilal’s wife).    </p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Sumati has taken no part in the action.   Of the remaining defendants, Radiatben, Punit and Priti have aligned themselves with Sangeeta.   In effect, they are additional claimants, and they were represented at the trial by Sangeeta’s counsel (Mr Mark Cunningham QC and Mr Stephen Tudway, who also appear before us).   Ramesh was separately represented at the trial (by Mr John Smart of counsel), but has taken no part in this appeal.   The remaining eight defendants (that is to say, Tarachand, Ratilal, Ratilal’s wife Kasturben, and his sisters Hansa, Sushila, Anjna, Panna and Damianti) oppose the relief sought: i.e. they are the effective defendants.    They were represented at the trial by Mr Nicholas Stewart QC and Mr Scott Pearman.   Before us, they are represented by Mr Ajmalul Hossain QC and Mr Richard Clegg of counsel.   </p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The dispute which has led to the action concerns the beneficial ownership of various properties registered in the names of one or more of C. B. Shah’s extended family, including a property at 85/87 South Road, Southall known in the family as “the Big House” (and I shall so call it) and numbers 299 and 301 Barking Road, East Ham (“the Barking Road properties”).  The respondents claim that all the properties in issue (including the Big House and the Barking Road properties) have at all material times been assets of a partnership carried on by the six brothers as equal partners and known as Fine Fabrics; and that, in consequence, on the deaths of Gulabchand, Rajnikant and Shantilal a one-sixth undivided share in those properties formed part of their respective estates.   </p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">At trial, the appellants contended that all twelve children of C.B. Shah (i.e. including the six sisters) were equal partners in Fine Fabrics, with the result that the estates of the three deceased brothers are entitled only to a one-twelfth share each in properties belonging to the partnership, with each of the sisters taking a one-twelfth share.    They further contended that neither the Big House nor the Barking Road properties were partnership assets, the Big House being owned beneficially by the twelve children of C. B. Shah in equal shares and the Barking Road properties being owned beneficially by Ratilal and Kasturben (in whose names the Barking Road properties are registered).   In the alternative, they contended that even if the Big House and/or the Barking Road properties were assets of a partnership between the six brothers only, nevertheless the sisters were each entitled to a one twelfth beneficial share in the partnership assets under a constructive trust.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The action was tried before Miss Sonia Proudman QC, sitting as a Deputy Judge of the High Court, in the Chancery Division.   As already indicated, the deputy judge upheld Sangeeta’s claim.  By her order dated 1 August 2003 she declared (so far as is material for present purposes) that the partnership consisted of the six brothers, to the exclusion of their sisters; and that each of the properties in issue (including the Big House and the Barking Road properties) was an asset of the partnership.   She went on to order that the partnership be dissolved, and she granted consequential relief including an order for the sale of the properties.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">By their grounds of appeal, the appellants challenge the deputy judge’s findings as to the beneficial ownership of the Big House and of the Barking Road properties.   They contend (as they contended before the deputy judge) that the Big House and the Barking Road properties are not and have never been assets of the partnership.   The Big House, they contend, was acquired with the common intention (subsequently acted upon) that it should belong beneficially to all twelve children of C. B. Shah in equal shares.   As to the Barking Road properties, they repeat their contention that these properties were bought by Ratilal and Kasturben on their own account, as beneficial owners.   They do not challenge the deputy judge’s finding that only the brothers were partners in Fine Fabrics, but they contend that, by virtue of the contributions which the sisters made to the partnership business, each of the sisters is entitled under a constructive trust to an undivided one twelfth beneficial share in the partnership assets, including partnership properties.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The appellants also apply for permission to amend their grounds of appeal in order to seek a retrial.   In this connection, they seek to rely on additional evidence which was not before the deputy judge (the nature of which additional evidence will become clear in due course).   Although Mr Cunningham did not consent to the respondents’ applications to amend and to rely on additional evidence, in the interests of saving time he did not object to them.   We accordingly granted them.</p>

Gulabchand was born in 1928 and Ratilal in 1929.   They were followed by Sumati (born in 1935), Rajnikant (born in 1937), Hansa (born in 1939), Tarachand (born in 1941), Ramesh (born in 1942), Sushila (born in 1944), Shantilal (born in 1946), Anjna (born in 1947), Damianti (born in 1948) and Panna (born in 1950).   </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">C. B. Shah carried on a drapery business in Nairobi.   The business prospered, and by the mid-1950s C. B. Shah owned two drapery shops.   Ratilal helped his father in the business, but initially Gulabchand took a job elsewhere.   In 1963 Gulabchand joined his father and his brother in the business.     All the family lived together, and as the children grew older they worked in the shops without pay.    The family expenses were met from the profits of the business.   As and when the daughters married, they moved out of the family home and went to live with their husbands’ families.</p>

Ratilal was the driving force behind the business.    They were followed by their brothers.  Initially, they all lived in a flat over their shop at 86 The Green, Southall, but the flat proved too small and in 1971 the Big House was purchased for £17,100 in the names of Gulabchand and Shantilal.   In 1972 the children were joined by their parents, C. B. Shah having sold up his house and business in Nairobi.</p>

In 1984 C. B. Shah died, and later in the year Gulabchand’s wife also died.   Gulabchand was so distressed by his wife’s death that Ratilal resumed his role as head of the family.   As already mentioned, Gulabchand himself died on 29 June 1990, followed on 7 October 2000 by Rajnikant and on 18 May 2002 by Shantilal.</p>

In paragraph 63 of her judgment the deputy judge rejected Anjna’s case that a payment of £10,000 which she had made for the construction of an en suite bathroom at the Big House entitled her to a beneficial interest in the Big House, concluding that:</p>

She also noted that the partnership accounts did not include either the Big House or the Barking Road properties in the list of partnership assets.   She also referred to a loan facility document generated in 1996 in relation to a loan to the partnership, in which the surviving brothers described themselves as “all” the partners in the partnership.</p>

Under the terms of the draft, Ratilal, Shantilal, Tarachand and Ramesh constitute themselves trustees of a number of properties listed in the first schedule to the draft.   The significance of the draft Declaration of Trust lies in the fact that the list of properties includes the Big House and the Barking Road properties.   By the draft Declaration of Trust, the trustees declare that they hold the properties so listed on trust for the beneficiaries named in the second schedule.   The beneficiaries so named are: Ratilal, Ramesh, Shantilal, Tarachand, Jatin (Gulabchand’s son) and Radiatben (Rajnikant’s widow).    (The omission of Rajnikant and the inclusion of his widow strongly suggests to me that the schedules were completed after Rajnikant’s death on 7 October 2000, a matter to which I shall return later in this judgment.)   The computer-generated footer to the draft reads: “<span style="font-style:italic">My docs: Trust R. C. Shah</span>” (the initials ‘R. C.’ being shared  by Ratilal, Rajnikant and Ramesh).</p>

On the other hand, the brothers, including Shantilal, believed that they could deal with it by the draft declaration in the same way as the other business properties.  In the telephone conversation of March 2001 Ratilal showed his belief that the big house belonged to only the brothers.  This is consonant with the fact that money was sent from Kenya on a regular basis to the brothers and the brothers alone and it was the brothers who decided how it should be applied.  Properties were vested in the brothers and the brothers alone.  It seems to me that the only inference I can draw is that no distinction was made between the beneficial ownership of the Big House and any of the other assets purchased from moneys from Kenya in the names of the brothers. ”</span></p>

He submits that the deputy judge failed to give appropriate weight to the evidence of Ramesh and Tarachand.   He further submits (relying on bank statements which were not in evidence at the trial) that the deputy judge was in error in finding (in paragraph 68 of her judgment) that the mortgage on the Barking Road properties was discharged from the proceeds of an endowment policy the premiums on which had been paid by the partnership.   He submits that the bank statements prove that payments of mortgage interest were made by standing order out of an account in the joint names of Ratilal and Kasturben, and that during the period from 1997 to 2000 premiums on the endowment policy were also paid out of that account.  He further contends that, contrary to the deputy judge’s finding, Ratilal had not accepted in cross-examination that the premiums on the endowment policy were paid by the partnership.   </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">For the respondents, Mr  Cunningham submits that the draft Declaration of Trust, coupled with Sangeeta’s record of her telephone conversation with Ratilal on 14 March 2001 (which the deputy judge found to be an accurate record), are the key documents in the case; and that they lead inevitably to the rejection of the appellants’ contentions on all three limbs of their appeal (viz. the Barking Road properties, the Big House, and the constructive trust issue).   At the very least, he submits, they are more than sufficient to justify the findings which the deputy judge made.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the Atul Shah letter, Mr Cunningham points out that there is no witness statement from Atul Shah, notwithstanding that he had been specifically asked to provide one.   He also reminds us of the evidence of Punit (to which I referred earlier) as to Rajnikant’s state of health, and his virtual immobility, in the months prior to his death.  He also submits that the fact that Rajnikant’s widow is included as a beneficiary in place of Rajnikant suggests that the draft Declaration of Trust was not drawn up until after his death  (a point which  I mentioned earlier: see paragraph 30 above).   However, says Mr Cunningham, all this is beside the point, since it is clear from the record of the telephone conversation that not only did Ratilal know about, and agree to, the terms of the draft Declaration of Trust, but that he also exercised some degree of control over its terms.   So, submits Mr Cunningham, it matters not which of the brothers actually contacted Atul Shah.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Cunningham submits that it is highly significant that not once in the course of the telephone conversation with Sangeeta did Ratilal mention his sisters, whether as partners or as part beneficial owners of the partnership assets under a constructive trust.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Turning to the Barking Road properties, Mr Cunningham submits that since the draft Declaration of Trust post-dated the redemption of the mortgage, it is unnecessary to investigate such evidence as there is as to the contributions which Ratilal may have made to its redemption (whether directly by making payments of mortgage interest or indirectly by paying premiums on the endowment policy).   In any event, he submits, there is no evidence as to how the joint account of Ratilal and Kasturben was funded.  Moreover, he reminds us that the Barking Road properties were purchased in 1985 (some 12 years before 1997, which is the first year to which the bank statements relate).   As to the absence of any mention of the Barking Road properties in the partnership accounts, Mr Cunningham reminds us that following the death of Gulabchand’s wife in 1984 Ratilal resumed his role as head of the family.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the constructive trust issue, Mr Cunningham accepts that as a matter of law non-monetary contributions may suffice to give rise to a constructive trust, provided that any such contributions are sufficiently ‘direct’.   On the facts of the instant case, he submits, the deputy judge was plainly correct to reject the constructive trust claim.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I accept Mr Cunningham’s submissions.   I agree with him that the terms of the draft Declaration of Trust, coupled with what Ratilal said to Sangeeta in the course of the telephone conversation on 14 March 2001, completely undermine the appellants’ case.   Nor, in my judgment, does the Atul Shah letter take the matter any further, for the reasons Mr Cunningham gave.   Even if it was the case that it was Rajnikant who attended at Atul Shah’s office and gave instructions for the drawing up of the draft Declaration of Trust, the irresistible inference from what Ratilal said in the course of the telephone conversation is that it was he, and not Rajnikant, who was the controlling mind behind the project.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the Barking Road properties, the deputy judge was in any event fully entitled to infer from such evidence as was before her that the purchase of those properties was “mainly funded by the partnership” (see paragraph 68 of her judgment).    The bank statements on which the appellants now seek to rely do not seem to me to take the matter any further.   In particular, as Mr Cunningham pointed out, there is no evidence as to how the joint account was funded.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The appeal in relation to the Big House is, in my judgment, equally hopeless.   The deputy judge was fully entitled to make the findings she did on the evidence before her.   Once again, as Mr Cunningham has pointed out, the appellants’ case in relation to the Big House flatly contradicts what Ratilal said in the course of the telephone conversation.   </p>

The suggestion that, notwithstanding that the sisters were not partners in Fine Fabrics, they are nevertheless entitled to beneficial interest in the partnership assets as if they had been partners seems to me, with all respect to Mr Hossain, to be bordering on the fanciful.    In any event, even if such a claim is conceptually possible, the facts as found by the judge do not begin to establish it, in my judgment.</p>
